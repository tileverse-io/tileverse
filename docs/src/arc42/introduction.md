# Introduction and Goals

## Problem Statement

The geospatial data processing domain has undergone a fundamental paradigm shift, moving away from traditional "download-and-process" workflows towards **cloud-native** data access patterns. Modern cloud-native formats like **Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG)**, **PMTiles**, **GeoParquet**, **Zarr**, and **FlatGeobuf** are designed to leverage **HTTP range requests**, allowing applications to fetch only the specific byte ranges needed for queries rather than downloading entire multi-gigabyte files.

However, the Java ecosystem has suffered from significant **architectural fragmentation** in supporting these patterns. Each major geospatial library has developed its own isolated I/O solution:

- **imageio-ext**: Internal `RangeReader` SPI for COG support
- **netCDF-Java**: Custom `cdms3://` protocol for Zarr access  
- **PMTiles readers**: Require user-implemented `FileChannel` wrappers
- **GeoParquet libraries**: Either rely on heavyweight Spark dependencies or embed databases via JNI

This fragmentation creates:
- **Code duplication** across the ecosystem
- **Inconsistent APIs** for similar operations
- **High barriers to entry** for new format development
- **Vendor lock-in** to specific cloud providers

## Goals and Requirements

### Functional Goals

1. **Unified I/O Abstraction**: Provide a single, lightweight library that abstracts range-based I/O operations across multiple storage backends
2. **Multi-Cloud Support**: Support Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, and generic HTTP/HTTPS sources
3. **Performance Optimization**: Enable intelligent caching, block alignment, and efficient data access patterns
4. **Format Agnostic**: Serve as a foundation that any binary format reader can build upon

### Quality Goals

| Priority | Quality Attribute | Motivation |
|----------|------------------|------------|
| 1 | **Performance** | Sub-second response times for data access operations |
| 2 | **Reliability** | Robust error handling and network resilience |
| 3 | **Usability** | Simple, intuitive API that reduces integration complexity |
| 4 | **Maintainability** | Modular design enabling easy extension and testing |
| 5 | **Portability** | Cross-platform compatibility and minimal dependencies |

## Stakeholders

| Role | Concerns | Contact |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Java Developers** | Easy integration, clear documentation, reliable performance | Community |
| **Library Authors** | Stable API, extensible architecture, minimal dependencies | OSS Community |
| **Application Architects** | Cloud vendor neutrality, security, scalability | Enterprise Users |
| **Performance Engineers** | Caching efficiency, memory usage, network optimization | Technical Teams |
| **DevOps Teams** | Configuration management, monitoring, troubleshooting | Operations |

## Business Context

### Ecosystem Integration

The library is designed to fill the **missing architectural layer** in the Java geospatial ecosystemâ€”comparable to Python's **fsspec** library. By providing this foundation, we enable:

- **Format libraries** to focus on parsing logic instead of I/O plumbing
- **Application developers** to use a consistent API across all cloud-native formats
- **The broader ecosystem** to consolidate around a common, well-maintained standard

### Competitive Advantage

Unlike existing solutions that are tightly coupled to specific frameworks:
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependency footprint
- **Universal**: Works with any Java application or framework
- **Extensible**: Plugin architecture for new storage backends
- **Modern**: Built with contemporary Java concurrency and performance patterns
