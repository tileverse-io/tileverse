- Important runtime processes

### 7. [Deployment View](deployment-view.md)
- Technical infrastructure
- Mapping of software to hardware

### 8. [Crosscutting Concepts](crosscutting.md)
- Regulations and solutions for recurring or system-wide topics

### 9. [Architecture Decisions](decisions.md)
- Important, expensive, risky or critical decisions
- ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)

### 10. [Quality Requirements](quality-requirements.md)
- Quality tree with scenarios and priorities
- Quality scenarios and acceptance criteria

### 11. [Risks and Technical Debt](risks.md)

## Target Audience

This technical documentation is primarily intended for:

- **Software Architects** designing systems that integrate the library
- **Technical Leaders** making technology decisions
- **Senior Developers** understanding implementation details
- **Quality Engineers** analyzing non-functional requirements
- **Operations Teams** deploying and monitoring applications

## Key Architectural Highlights

### Design Patterns

The library extensively uses proven design patterns:

- **Decorator Pattern**: For composable functionality (caching, block alignment)
- **Template Method**: For consistent behavior across implementations
- **Builder Pattern**: For fluent, type-safe configuration
- **Factory Pattern**: For creating readers from URIs

### Quality Attributes

The architecture prioritizes these quality attributes:

- **Performance**: Multi-level caching and optimization strategies
- **Extensibility**: Easy addition of new data sources and decorators
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and resilience patterns
- **Usability**: Clean APIs and comprehensive documentation
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and testable design

### Technology Choices

Key technology decisions include:

- **Java 17+**: Modern Java features with LTS support
- **NIO Channels**: High-performance I/O operations
- **Caffeine**: High-performance caching library
- **AWS/Azure/GCS SDKs**: Native cloud provider integration
- **TestContainers**: Realistic integration testing

## Architectural Diagrams

All architectural diagrams in this documentation are generated from [Structurizr DSL](https://structurizr.com/) definitions located in the `docs/structurizr/` directory. These diagrams provide multiple views of the same architectural model, ensuring consistency across all views.

To regenerate the diagrams:

```bash
cd docs/structurizr
./structurizr-generate-diagrams.sh
```

## Document Conventions

Throughout this documentation, we use the following conventions:

- **Components** are shown in `monospace font`
- **External Systems** are highlighted in *italics*
- **Quality Attributes** are shown in **bold**
- Code examples use syntax highlighting
- Architectural elements use consistent naming across all views
