# Glossary

## Overview

This glossary defines key terms, concepts, and abbreviations used throughout the Tileverse Range Reader project documentation and codebase. Understanding these terms is essential for developers, contributors, and users of the library.

## Core Concepts

### Range Reader
**Definition**: An interface that provides efficient random access to byte ranges within a data source without loading the entire content into memory.

**Usage**: Core abstraction for reading specific byte ranges (offset, length) from files, HTTP resources, or cloud storage.

**Example**: `reader.readRange(1024, 512)` reads 512 bytes starting at offset 1024.

### Decorator Pattern
**Definition**: A structural design pattern that allows behavior to be added to objects dynamically by wrapping them in decorator objects.

**Usage**: Central architectural pattern used to compose functionality like caching, block alignment, and authentication.

**Example**: `CachingRangeReader` wraps a base reader to add memory caching capabilities.

### Builder Pattern
**Definition**: A creational design pattern that constructs complex objects step by step using a fluent API.

**Usage**: Used for configuring and creating `RangeReader` instances with type-safe, readable code.

**Example**: `S3RangeReader.builder().uri(uri).withCredentials(provider).build()`

### Block Alignment
**Definition**: An optimization technique that aligns read requests to fixed-size blocks to improve I/O efficiency and caching effectiveness.

**Usage**: Reduces network overhead by reading larger aligned blocks instead of arbitrary ranges.

**Implementation**: `BlockAlignedRangeReader` decorator with configurable block sizes.

### ByteBuffer Pool
**Definition**: A memory management technique that reuses `ByteBuffer` instances to reduce allocation overhead and garbage collection pressure.

**Usage**: Planned enhancement for high-throughput scenarios to improve performance and memory efficiency.

**Target**: 90% reduction in ByteBuffer allocations for sustained workloads.

## Cloud Storage Terms

### S3-Compatible Storage
**Definition**: Storage services that implement the Amazon S3 API specification, allowing use of S3 client libraries.

**Examples**: Amazon S3, MinIO, LocalStack, DigitalOcean Spaces, Wasabi

**Usage**: Unified access pattern through `S3RangeReader` regardless of actual storage provider.

### Blob Storage
**Definition**: Object storage service optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data.

**Examples**: Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage

**Characteristics**: REST API access, metadata support, multiple storage tiers.

### ETag
**Definition**: HTTP response header that provides a unique identifier for a specific version of a resource.

**Usage**: Cache validation to ensure consistency in distributed environments.

**Implementation**: Planned for Version 1.2 cache validation features.

### SAS Token
**Definition**: Shared Access Signature - a URI that grants restricted access rights to Azure Storage resources.

**Usage**: Secure, time-limited access to Azure Blob Storage without exposing account keys.

**Scope**: Can be limited to specific containers, operations, and time periods.

## Authentication & Security

### Credential Provider
**Definition**: An abstraction that supplies authentication credentials for cloud services.

**Implementation**: Delegates to cloud SDK default credential chains (AWS, Azure, GCP).

**Security**: Never stores credentials directly in library instances.

### IAM (Identity and Access Management)
**Definition**: Cloud service for securely controlling access to AWS/Azure/GCP resources.

**Usage**: Controls which users/applications can access specific storage resources.

**Best Practice**: Use least-privilege principles for production deployments.

### Bearer Token
**Definition**: An access token used in HTTP Authorization headers for API authentication.

**Format**: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Usage**: Common pattern for REST API and OAuth 2.0 authentication.

## Performance & Caching

**Target**: >80% for typical geospatial workloads with spatial locality.

**Impact**: Higher hit rates significantly reduce latency and cloud storage costs.

### Cold Start

**Mitigation**: Predictive prefetching and intelligent cache warming strategies.

**Duration**: Typically improves after 10-100 requests depending on access patterns.

### Throughput
**Definition**: The amount of data processed per unit of time, measured in bytes/second or operations/second.

**Target**: >500 operations/second sustained throughput for concurrent workloads.

**Factors**: Network bandwidth, cache efficiency, concurrent request handling.

### Latency
**Definition**: The time delay between making a request and receiving the response.

**Target**: <50ms P99 latency for cached operations, <500ms for cold reads.
