     * This method provides the core implementation of range reading with comprehensive
     * parameter validation, boundary checking, and buffer management following standard
     * NIO conventions. It delegates the actual data reading to {@link #readRangeNoFlip(long, int, ByteBuffer)}.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Parameter Validation:</strong>
     * <ul>
     * <li>Validates that offset and length are non-negative</li>
     * <li>Ensures target buffer is not null and not read-only</li>
     * <li>Checks that target buffer has sufficient remaining capacity</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * <strong>Boundary Handling:</strong>
     * <ul>
     * <li>For zero-length reads, returns immediately with 0 bytes read</li>
     * <li>For reads starting beyond EOF, returns 0 bytes read</li>
     * <li>For reads extending beyond EOF, truncates to available data</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * <strong>Buffer Management (NIO Conventions):</strong>
     * Following standard Java NIO conventions, this method writes data into the buffer
     * and advances the position:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Data is written starting at the buffer's current position</li>
     * <li>Position is advanced by the number of bytes written</li>
     * <li>Limit remains unchanged</li>
     * <li>Caller must call {@code flip()} to prepare buffer for reading</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * <strong>Thread Safety:</strong>
     * This method is thread-safe when the underlying {@link #readRangeNoFlip(long, int, ByteBuffer)}
     * implementation is thread-safe.
     *
     * @param offset The byte offset to read from (must be >= 0)
     * @param length The number of bytes to read (must be >= 0)
     * @param target The ByteBuffer to read into, starting at its current position
     * @return The number of bytes actually read (may be less than requested if EOF is reached)
     * @throws IOException                      If an I/O error occurs during reading
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException         If offset or length is negative, target is null,

    /**
     * Reads bytes from the source into the target buffer without preparing the buffer for consumption.
     * <p>
     * This is the core template method that concrete implementations must override to provide
     * the actual data reading logic. Unlike {@link #readRange(long, int, ByteBuffer)}, this
     * method does not perform parameter validation or buffer preparation - those responsibilities
     * are handled by the calling {@code readRange} method.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Implementation Requirements:</strong>
     * <ul>
     * <li>Read exactly {@code actualLength} bytes from the source at {@code offset}</li>
     * <li>Write the data into {@code target} starting at its current position</li>
     * <li>Advance the target buffer's position by the number of bytes written</li>
     * <li>Do NOT modify the target buffer's limit</li>
     * <li>Return the actual number of bytes read (may be less than requested if EOF reached)</li>
     * <li>Must be thread-safe for concurrent access</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * <strong>Parameter Guarantees:</strong>
     * When this method is called by {@link #readRange(long, int, ByteBuffer)}, the following
     * conditions are guaranteed:
     * <ul>
     * <li>{@literal offset >= 0}</li>
     * <li>{@literal actualLength > 0} (zero-length reads are handled by the caller)</li>
     * <li>{@code target} is not null and not read-only</li>
     * <li>{@literal target.remaining() >= actualLength}</li>
     * <li>{@literal offset < source.size()} (reads starting beyond EOF are handled by caller)</li>
     * <li>{@code actualLength} may be less than originally requested if the read would extend beyond EOF</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * <strong>Buffer State Contract:</strong>
     * <pre>
     * {@code
     * // Before calling readRangeNoFlip:
     * int initialPosition = target.position();
     * int initialLimit = target.limit();
     *
     * // After readRangeNoFlip returns:
     * int bytesRead = readRangeNoFlip(offset, actualLength, target);
     * assert target.position() == initialPosition + bytesRead;
     * assert target.limit() == initialLimit; // unchanged
     * }
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * The calling {@code readRange} method will then reset the position and adjust the limit
     * to prepare the buffer for immediate consumption by the caller.
     *
     * @param offset       The byte offset to read from (guaranteed to be {@literal >= 0 and < source size})
     * @param actualLength The number of bytes to read (guaranteed to be {@literal > 0} and within buffer capacity)
     * @param target       The ByteBuffer to write into (guaranteed to be non-null, writable, and have sufficient capacity)
     * @return The number of bytes actually read and written to the target buffer
     * @throws IOException If an I/O error occurs during reading from the underlying source
