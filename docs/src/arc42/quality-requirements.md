## Quality Trade-offs

### Performance vs. Memory Usage

**Trade-off**: Larger cache sizes improve performance but increase memory usage.

**Decision**: Configurable cache limits with sensible defaults
- Memory cache: 1000 entries default, configurable
- Disk cache: 1GB default, configurable  
- Block size: 64KB memory / 1MB disk, configurable

### Simplicity vs. Power

**Trade-off**: Simple API vs. advanced configuration options.

**Decision**: Layered API design
- **Simple**: `RangeReader.fromUri("s3://bucket/file")`
- **Advanced**: Full builder pattern with all options
- **Expert**: Direct decorator composition

### Reliability vs. Performance

**Trade-off**: Retry logic and error handling add latency overhead.

**Decision**: Configurable resilience
- Default: 3 retries with exponential backoff
- Fast-fail mode: Single attempt for latency-critical scenarios
- Circuit breaker: Configurable failure thresholds

### New Functional Requirements

#### Multiple Range Requests

**Requirement**: Support efficient batching of multiple range requests.

```java
// Future API design
List<Range> ranges = Arrays.asList(
    new Range(0, 1024),
    new Range(5000, 2048),
    new Range(10000, 4096)
);
List<ByteBuffer> results = reader.readRanges(ranges);
```

**Priority**: Medium
**Justification**: Reduces network overhead for applications that need multiple non-contiguous ranges.

#### SPI-Based Provider Discovery

**Requirement**: Support extensible range reader provider discovery without hardcoded URI scheme detection.

**Details**:
- Service Provider Interface for custom range reader implementations
- Auto-discovery of providers from classpath using Java SPI
- Enhanced `RangeReaderBuilder.fromUri()` with provider delegation
- Elimination of hardcoded scheme-to-implementation mapping

**Priority**: Medium
**Justification**: Enables third-party extensions and removes need for `RangeReaderFactory` duplication.

#### ByteBuffer Pool Management

**Requirement**: Provide pooled ByteBuffer management to reduce allocation overhead.

```java
// Future API design with buffer pooling
var pool = ByteBufferPool.create()
    .initialSize(100)
    .maxSize(1000)
    .bufferSize(64 * 1024)
    .build();

var reader = S3RangeReader.builder()
    .uri(uri)
    .bufferPool(pool)
    .build();

try (var pooledBuffer = pool.acquire(length)) {
    int bytesRead = reader.readRange(offset, length, pooledBuffer.getBuffer());
    // Process buffer
    // Buffer automatically returned to pool on close
}
```

**Priority**: High
**Justification**: Constant creation and disposal of ByteBuffers creates significant memory pressure and GC overhead in high-throughput scenarios. A pool provides:
- **Memory efficiency**: Reuses existing buffers instead of constant allocation
- **GC pressure reduction**: Fewer objects created and collected
- **Performance improvement**: Eliminates allocation overhead in critical paths
- **Size optimization**: Pool can maintain buffers of various sizes
- **Thread safety**: Pool manages concurrent access to buffers

#### Cache Invalidation with ETags

**Requirement**: Implement ETag-based cache validation for cloud storage.

```java
var reader = S3RangeReader.builder()
    .uri(uri)
    .withETagValidation(true)
    .cacheValidationInterval(Duration.ofMinutes(5))
    .build();
```

**Priority**: Medium
**Justification**: Ensures cache consistency in multi-instance deployments.

#### Automated Benchmarking

**Requirement**: Continuous performance monitoring and regression detection.

- JMH benchmarks run on every release
- Performance regression detection (>10% degradation fails build)
- Historical performance tracking and reporting
- Cloud provider performance comparison

**Priority**: High
**Justification**: Maintains performance guarantees across releases.
